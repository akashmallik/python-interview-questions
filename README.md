## Introduction

1. ### What does the Zen of Python mean?

    The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 "guiding principles" for writing computer programs that influence the design of the Python programming language. Software engineer Tim Peters wrote this set of principles and posted it on the Python mailing list in 1999. [More details..](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python)

2. ### What does PEP 8 mean?

    PEP 8 is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code. The primary focus of PEP 8 is to improve the readability and consistency of Python code. [More details..](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

## Core Python

3. ### First Class functions in Python?

    First class objects in a language are handled uniformly throughout. They may be stored in data structures, passed as arguments, or used in control structures. A programming language is said to support first-class functions if it treats functions as first-class objects. Python supports the concept of First Class functions.

    Properties of first class functions:
    * A function is an instance of the Object type.
    * You can store the function in a variable.
    * You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.
    * You can return the function from a function.
    * You can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists…

4. ### Python Anonymous/Lambda Function?

    In Python, an anonymous function is a function that is defined without a name. While normal functions are defined using the def keyword in Python, anonymous functions are defined using the lambda keyword. Hence, anonymous functions are also called lambda functions. [More details..](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/anonymous-function)

    ***Note:*** Lambda functions can have any number of arguments but only one expression.

5. ### Decorators in Python?

    A decorator is a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. Decorators are usually called before the definition of a function you want to decorate.

6. ### Generators in Python?

    Python generator functions are a special kind of function that return a lazy iterator. These are objects that you can loop over like a list. However, unlike lists, lazy iterators do not store their contents in memory. [More details...](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/)
